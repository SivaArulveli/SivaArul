# “Namaskaram! Welcome to SivaArulVeli.

**Sri Siva Swamigal** is a Vasi Siddhar whose experience transcends the physical boundaries of normal human perception and the concepts of space and time. His unconditional love and concern for fellow beings, irrespective of their religion, caste or social standing, has touched the hearts of thousands of beings. His presence has inspired many beings to take up the spiritual path, for individual growth and for the welfare of all living beings. SivaArulVeli is an invitation into this vast space of Siva’s boundless grace!”

##About:

In the recent times, Sri Siva Swamigal reincarnated in Surandai at 1926 on the day of Chithirai Nakshathram in the month of Vaikasi and , and lived in Chidambaram temple for more than four decades. During his stay in Chidambaram, in the summer months, he could be spotted distributing buttermilk to thirsty visitors. Using funds gathered from his friends and well-wishers, he also organized regular anna danam near the South gate of the Natarajar temple.

SivaArulVeli (literally translated as Siva Grace Space) is an attempt to bring down the grace and intelligence that is beyond words, into the everyday experience of the seeker. For this, we offer certain tools to make the seeker more receptive to grace and supplement it with scientifically prepared products to create the necessary atmosphere for inner growth. Activities

##Siva Annadhanam:

**Annadhanam** is an offering of consecrated food (prasadam) with the twin aims of allieviating hunger and allowing the seeker to experience grace. Countless yogis and siddhas encourage the practice of annadhanam as a means to evolve within oneself. SivaArulVeli members regularly conduct monthly annadhanam activities at Siva Adhistanam. In addition, larger annadhanam events are conducted during Aani Tirumanjanam and Arudra Darshanam at Chidamabaram Nataraja temple. For more details [visit] ( http://sivaannadhanam.blogspot.in/)

##Siva Gurupooja

On Feb 7th 2008 (Thai Amavasya), Siva shed his mortal coil. For the well being of humanity, Siva's physical frame is preserved in the Samadhi at Siva Adhistanam in Sivapuri. The temple is located 6 km south east of Nataraja temple. Here, Siva's body is seated facing north and a bana linga is established on top to radiate his grace further. Siva Adhistanam serves as a space where anyone can grow through the four fold path of sariyai, kriyayi, yogam and jnanam. Following the tradition of the Siddhas, a group of volunteers and friends organize Guru Pooja (on Thai Amavasya) every year. On this day, it is very easy to experience Siva’s grace and evolve further on the inner path. For more details about Gurupooja please contact us at hello@sivaarulveli.com
